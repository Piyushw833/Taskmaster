# Overview  
Oculis is an AI-powered, smart real estate platform that centralizes 3D property scans, documents, and analytics into one immersive, interactive dashboard. Designed for real estate agents, developers, buyers, and investors, it helps streamline property evaluation, contract handling, and decision-making using 3D digital twins, GPT-based agents, and secure cloud collaboration.

By merging visualization, valuation, and virtual interaction, Oculis solves the inefficiencies of traditional property workflows and enhances clarity, accessibility, and speed throughout the real estate lifecycle.
